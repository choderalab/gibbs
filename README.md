Gibbs sampling for expanded ensembles and replica exchange simulations

## Description

This project provides example implementations illustrating the use of Gibbs sampling to improve the efficiency of expanded ensembles (e.g. simulated tempering, simulated scaling) and replica-exchange (e.g. parallel tempering, Hamiltonian exchange) simulations. 
Examples are provided using [OpenMM](http://openmm.org) and [gromacs](http://gromacs.org).

## Manifest

* `openmm/` - examples for the OpenMM molecular simulation package
* `gromacs/` - examples for the gromacs molecular simulation suite

## Keywords
